3. Write a python program to print first n integers. Take n input from the user. 
Hint: Use while loop doing this.

4. Write a python program to print first n fibonacci sequence. Take n input from the user. 
Hint: A fibonacci sequence follows this rule: F(n+1) = F(n) + F(n-1) where first two numbers are 0 and 1 of the sequence. 
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 ...

5. Write a python program to check if a three digit number is palindrome or not. 
Hint: Palindrome is a number which is same when read from either left hand side or right hand side. For example: 101 or 141 or 656 etc.

Practice Set
1. Write a python program to check if a number is multiple of 7 or not.

3. Write a python program to check if a number is prime or not. 
Hint: a prime number is one which can only be exactly divided by 1 or the same number. 

4. Write a python program which prints cube numbers less than a certain number provided by the user. 
For example: if user inputs 33. 
Output should be 0, 1, 8, 27

5. Write a python program which works as a calculator, it only does two operation addition and substraction. 
Everytime the program asks for two numbers and then operation. The program should be running all the time until user enters stop.

6. Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000
(both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a
single line.

7. Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of
